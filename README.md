## Vehicle-Plate-Recognition

## Project: Vehicle Plate Recognition using CCTV surveillance

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [YOLO v8](https://yolov8.com/)
- [YOLO v9]([https://yolov8.com/](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov9/))
- [EasyOcr](https://pypi.org/project/easyocr/)

You must also install software to run and execute a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Licence_Plate_Detection_YOLO_V8.ipynb` notebook file and `licence_plate_using_YOLO_V9.ipynb`.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Licence_Plate_Detection_YOLO_V8.ipynb/` (that contains this README) and also `licence_plate_using_YOLO_V9.ipynb`and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Resume_Screening.ipynb
```
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Resume_Screening.ipynb
```
or open with Juoyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

Dataset used: https://universe.roboflow.com/mochoye/license-plate-detector-ogxxg
**Features**
* Result: Vehicle number plates are recognized using YOLO v8 and YOLO v9 models along with Easyocr.
